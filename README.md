# Project Title
This project is a simple smart contract for creating and managing a custom token using the Remix Ethereum IDE.

## Description
This project is a basic implementation of a custom token on the etherium blockchain. The contract MyToken includes public variables to store essential details about the token such as its name, abbreviation and total supply.
it also uses a mapping to keep track of the balances of different addresses. the 'mint' function allows new tokens to be created and assigned to an address effectively increasing the total supply and the balance of that address.
The "burn" functions reduces the total supply and the balance of an address but only if the address has enough tokens to burn.

## Getting started
## Executing program
To run this program, you can use remix, an online solidity IDE.
